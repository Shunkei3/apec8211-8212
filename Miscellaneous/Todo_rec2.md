## Contents:
+ Basic knowledge about probability theory
    * Independence
    * CDF and PDF
    * Definition of Var, Cov, Corr
        - Cov, Corr, E[Xe]
    * Linearity of expectation, covariance
    * Variance of the sum two variables
    * Jensen's Inequality
    




+ 2.2: Random variable: 
    * It's not random: 
        - Wikipedia: "The term 'random variable' can be misleading as it is not actually random nor a variable, but rather it is a function from possible outcomes"
    * It has a distribution. 
        - Eg) Flipping coin: the outcomes follows Bernoulli distribution (Rademacher distribution)
    * see also section 2.11 


+ 2.7: The definition of Distribution function

+ 2.8: 
    * Density function
        - definitions (two versions)
        - The corresponding function in the discrete setting is probability mass function
    * How should we do when we are asked weather a probability distribution function or a probability mass function is a valid probability function?


+ 2.5: Expectation
    * definition 
    * Continuous (2.13) and Discrete setting
        - section 2.15: Unifying notation for expectation 
    * Linearity of Expectation: 
        - E[a+bX] vs E[a+bX^2]
        - this idea connects to 2.18 Jensen's Inequality

+ 2.15: Mean and Variance
    * P40
