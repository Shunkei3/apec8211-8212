# 3rd Recitation
## Scope:
+ Conditional expectations
	* E: 2.3, 2.5-2.10
	* PSE: *4.14-4.16*

+ Projection, regression, and identification
	* E: 2.11-2.17, *2.18-2.19*, 2.25, 2.28, 2.30



## Topics:

### Probability and Statistics

+ Conditional distribution and conditional expectation
	* PSE 4.14:
		- the conditional expectation is the central tendency of a conditional distribution
	* What is conditional distribution?
		- visualization with 
			+ 2D
			+ 3D
	* This connects to CEF theorem!!!
		- CEF -> Linear porjection 


+ Law of iterated expectation: 
	* E[X] = E[E[X|Y]]
	* Monte Calro Simulation?
		- like assignment 2
		- to confirm law of iterated expectation
	* Proof: Independence -> Mean independence -> Correlation
	* Covariance and correlation
		



### Homework:
+ 2nd homework: 
	* Monte Calro Simulation 
		- to check LIE


## Idea
+ Independent 
	* statistical independent
	* mean independent ()
	* uncorrelation

+ CEF theorem: It's important to understand that 
	* Low of iterated expectations: 
		- understand CEF and its properties 
	* 

+ A little bit of Monte Carlo Simulation
