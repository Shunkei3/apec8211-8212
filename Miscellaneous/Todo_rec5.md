+ Review variance in the matric form:
	* Sandwitch form
	* Assignment 2, problem 1-(b), and problem 2

+ Talk about variance estimator
	* use Kennedy's explanation

+ Practice to report heteroskedasticity-robust standard error
	* stargazer with replaced standard error

+ R
	* How to run a regression in R
	* 	




+ Assignment 4:
	* 
+ Variance:
	* plug-in estimator of $\sigma^2$ is biased toward zero (PSE 139)
		- this connects to 
	* explnaton about the sandwitch form 




## Recitation 6

+ Plug-in estimator:
+ bias and consistency
