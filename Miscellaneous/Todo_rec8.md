# For recitation 8
+ Hypothesis tesing in regression 
	* starting from a simple concept for hypothesis testing for sample mean
+ explain the notation (review: inference P23, OLS asymptotics p10)
	* asymptotic variance
	* actual variance (for liear function. In nonlinear case, we don;t have this)
	* variance estimator
	* explian the definition

+ relationship betwen aymptotic variance and actual variance 


+ We covered het-robust se estimates calculation in the last time
+ cover the Delta method
	* real applicaton 


+ What is delta method?
	* It's a concept of the asymptotic theorem
	* The goal is to compute the standard errors for the margins of a regression. 
		- especially powerful to estimate the se for the margin of a nonlinear ettimator like probit or logit. 
				* These are difficult to obtain the theoretical. 
	* The delta method is a general method for deriving the variance of a function of asymptotically normal random variables with known variance. 


+ for linear regression case:
	*
