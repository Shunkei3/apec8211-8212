	* plug-in estimator of $\sigma^2$ is biased toward zero (PSE 139)
		- this connects to 
	* explnaton about the sandwitch form 

+ Variance estimator 
	* R

		- Practice to report heteroskedasticity-robust standard error
			+ stargazer with replaced standard error

+ explian how to report regression table
	* stargazer
+ why quadratic form can measures the length (or distance) of x_i?

# For recitation 8

	* starting from a simple concept for hypothesis testing for sample mean
+ explain the notation (review: inference P23, OLS asymptotics p10)
	* asymptotic variance
	* actual variance
	* variance estimator
	* explian the definition
