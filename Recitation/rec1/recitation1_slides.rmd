<span style="color:red">Please read the document "Assignments in APEC 8211 and 8212".</span>

.content-box-green[**Assignment Submission**]
+ Submit your assignment as <span style="color:blue">one single PDF file including R codes and R outputs</span>
+ To create a PDF document: 
  * LaTeX, R markdown (I will demonstrate how to do it later)
+ Submission location: Gradescope

<span style="color:red">Please read the document "Assignments in APEC 8211 and 8212".</span>

.content-box-green[**Assignment Submission**]
+ Submit your assignment as <span style="color:blue">one single PDF file including R codes and R outputs</span>
+ To create a PDF document: 
  * LaTeX, R markdown (I will demonstrate how to do it later)
+ Submission location: Gradescope

.content-box-green[**Folder Organization**]
+ Every file needed for a given assignment—data, R codes, etc.—should be in the same directory (folder).

+ Example:

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/folder_structure.png")
```

# Create PDF reports using R markdown
Of course LaTeX might be a first choice to make PDF report, but you can build a PDF report with [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

<br>

.content-box-green[**Pros**]

+ You can use LaTeX math notations to write math equations 
+ You can easily incorporate R codes and R outputs in the same document

---
## How to do it?
From top-down of New file icon, crick R Markdown -> Select PDF format -> A new Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`) file pops up -> Crick "Knit" bottom to run the Rmd file

.panelset[ 

.panel[.panel-name[1.New .Rmd file]
```{r, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/step1.png")
```
  ]

.panel[.panel-name[2.Select PDF format]
```{r, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/step2.png")
```
  ]

.panel[.panel-name[3.Crick Knit]
```{r, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/step3.png")
```
  ]

.panel[.panel-name[4.Output]
```{r, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/step4.png")
```
  ]
]

+ When you knit your `.Rmd` file, you may get an error message. If you are asked to install `tinytex` package, follow that instruction (e.g. Run `install.packages("tinytex")`)

# Writing math equations with LaTeX Math Notations
See the document "Demonstration.pdf" on Canvas.
+ Section 1: Building blocks
+ Section 2: Example math equations

<br>

.content-box-green[**Exercise**]
+ Let's write some math equations using LaTeX math notations on your `.Rmd` (or `.rmd`) file and see it's correctly appeared on the output PDF document. 
+ Let's write some R codes and see how it looks like on the output file.

# Example R codes

.panelset[ 

.panel[.panel-name[`R Base`]
.small[
```{r, echo=T}
# === Load data === #
# New York Air Quality Measurements
# This data is R Built-in Data Sets
data(airquality)
# to see the description about the data run, ?airquality
```

```{r, echo=T}
# --- Subset data from June --- #
may_dt <- airquality[airquality$Month==6,]
# Let's see the first five rows
head(may_dt)
```

```{r, echo=T}
# --- mean temperature by month ---
mean_temp <- aggregate(airquality$Temp, by=list(month=airquality$Month), FUN=mean)

mean_temp
```
]
  ]

.panel[.panel-name[`data.table`]
+ Introduction of `data.table` is [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)

.small[
```{r, echo=T}
# === Load package === #
# installed.packages("data.table") #If you have not installed
library(data.table)

# To use data.table functions, convert the data into data.table class
setDT(airquality)
```

```{r, echo=T}
# --- Subset data from June --- #
may_dt <- airquality[Month==6,]
head(may_dt, 5)
```

```{r, echo=T}
# --- mean temperature by month ---
mean_temp <- airquality[,.(mean_temp = mean(Temp)), by=Month]
mean_temp
```

# About R coding

+ If you are interested in learning more about R programming, I recommend that you take APEC 8221 (001) Programming for Econometrics (taught by Ali and Joe, 7 week course, 2 credits).
