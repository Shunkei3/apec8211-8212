## Example: The effect of minimum wage on employment

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did0_0.png")
```

---
class: middle

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did1_1.png")
```


---
class: middle

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did1_1.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]

1. Which differences are observed? Which differences are not observed?
2. Which difference is the DID estimand, in other words ATT?
3. In what condition ATT is identified and how ?

## Parallel trend assumption

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did1_2.png")
```

<p style="text-align: center;">If <span style="color:red"><b>(2)</b></span> = <span style="color:red"><b>(3)</b></span> </p>, 

$$ATT = (1) = (4) - \color{red}{(2)} = (4) - \color{red}{(3)}$$

???
+ Change in outcomes for the treatment group before and after if the treatment group had not been treated.

class: middle

## Parallel trend assumption

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did1_2.png")
```

$$\begin{align*}
ATT 
  &= (2) \\
  &= E[Y_{i,2}(1)Y_{i,2}(0)|D_i=1] \\
  &= (4) - (3) \\
  &= E[Y_{i,2}(1) - Y_{i,1}(1)|D_i=1] - E[Y_{i,2}(0)Y_{i,1}(0)|D_i=0]
\end{align*}$$

## Violation of the parallel trend assumption
For example, 

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did3_vio1.png")
```

.content-box-green[**Question**]
Is ATT estimate from DID approach biased upward or downward?

.content-box-green[**Question**]

What if the assumption of no anticipation effect is violated? What does the figure look like?


---

class: middle

## Violation of the no anticipation effect

For example, 

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/did3_vio2.png")
```

???
+ So, the problem here is that depending on the treatment status in period two, the outcome changes. 
+ For example, knowing that the minimum wage decreases, employers might build new factories before the new policy starts but they would not if the minimum wage decreases.

Treatment needs to be an exogenous event.
<!--   * Specifically, conditional on $X_{it}$ for $\forall t$, $D_{it}$ and the idiosyncratic errors $\varepsilon_{it}$ are statistically independent
    - CIA implies no anticipation effect -->

.content-box-green[**Example**]

Card and Krueger (1994): 

+ Question: Does increase in minimum wage decrease the labor demand?

+ Exogenous event:  New Jersy's 1992 increase of the minimum hourly wage

.content-box-green[**Example**]

Eissa and Liebman (1996):
+ Question: Does tax credit affect labor supply and work hours?
+ Exogenous event: Major expansions of EITC of Tax Reform Act in 1986

DiTella and Schargrodsky (2004): 

+ Question: Does the street presence of police officer reduces car theft?
  * The key problem here is police forces are not allocated exogenously
+ Exogenous event: ?
