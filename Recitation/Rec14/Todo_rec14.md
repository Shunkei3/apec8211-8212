+ With potential outcome framework, How do you describe
	* Parallel trend assumption
	* no anticipation effect

+ What is the violation of overlap condition?



+ In what condition ATE and ATT are the same?



+ Question: 
	* Using $D_i$ and $T_i$, express complieres, always-takers, never-takers, and defiers


+ D needs to be exogenous event 
	* Specifically, conditional on $X_{it}$ for $\all t$, $D_{it}$ and the idiosyncratic errors $\varepsilon_{it}$ are statistically independent
		- CIA implies no anticipation effect

+ Example: 
	* Card and Krueger (1994): 
		- Question: Does increase in minimum wage decrease the labor demand?
		- Exogenous event D:  New Jersy's 1992 increase of the minimum hourly wage 
	* Eissa and Liebman (1996):
		- Question: Does tax credit affect labor supply and work hours?
		- Exogenous event D: Major expansions of EITC of Tax Reform Act in 1986
	* DiTella and Schargrodsky (2004): 
		- Question: Does the street presence of police officer reduces car theft?
		- Exogenous event D: An expansion of police deployment around the city due to a terrorist attack

+ Policy change is generally regarded as an exogenous shock. In the case of Card and Krueger (1994), the policy of minimum wage actually started after the it was  adopted, maybe people and
