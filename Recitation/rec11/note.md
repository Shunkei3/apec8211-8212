# Treatment assignment
+ Treatment is assigned by townships

**County1**: 22 townships (19 participated, 101 primary schools)
+ 9 pairs of trt and cnt + 1 trt
	* 10 townships are treatment group
	* 9 townships are control group

**County2**: 23 townships (18 participated, 155 primary schools)
+ 9 pairs of trt and cnt 
	+ 9 townships are treatment group
	+ 9 townships are control group

In other words: 
+ Treatment group: 19 townships 
+ Control group: 18 townships
+ 37 townships in total

# Problem:
+ **5 townships** which were supposed to be in the control group were actually treated
	+ 2 townships in County 1
	+ 3 townships in County 2
+ Also, "role reversal" occurred in 1 pair in County1 

Thus, 
+ 3 pairs from County1 
+ 3 pairs from County 
are invalid

# Final treatment and control pairs
+ County1:
	* 6 township pairs of trt and cont + 1 trt
+ County2
	* 6 township pairs of trt and cont

In other words: 
+ Treatment group: 13 townships 
+ Control group: 12 townships
+ 25 townships in total (compliant)
